Haconby Action Group was formed in July 2025. 

The aim of this website is to keep you, the residents of Haconby and Stainfield, informed.

The group’s mission:

- to stop National Grid from defacing the stretch of Lincolnshire countryside from Spalding to Leicestershire in order to transmit its power, which originates in Scotland, to the south of England.
- to make National Grid rethink its proposals.
- have they thought about the ‘other’ costs involved: our costs, the impact on our daily lives; 
- box tickers.
