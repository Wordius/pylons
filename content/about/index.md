Haconby Action Group was formed in July 2025. 

The aim of this website is to keep you, the residents of Haconby and Stainfield, informed.

The groupâ€™s mission:

- to stop National Grid from defacing the stretch of Lincolnshire countryside from Spalding to Leicestershire in order to transmit its power, which originates in Scotland, to the south of England.
- to make National Grid rethink its proposals.
